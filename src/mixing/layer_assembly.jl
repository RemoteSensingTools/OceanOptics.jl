# =============================================================================
# Layer assembly — take an OceanLayer and produce an OceanLayerOptics
# =============================================================================
#
# This is the main user-facing function of the elastic path. Given
#
#   • an OceanLayer (constituents + thickness)
#   • a wavelength grid λ_grid [nm]
#   • a truncation ℓ_max for the Legendre expansion
#
# produce a self-contained OceanLayerOptics bundle ready to feed into any
# plane-parallel RT solver using Matrix Operator / Adding-Doubling / Discrete
# Ordinates / etc.
#
# Algorithm
# ---------
# For each wavelength λ:
#   1. For each constituent c, compute (a_c, b_c, bb_c)
#   2. For each scattering constituent, obtain its phase function moments β_c
#   3. Sum extensive quantities:  a = Σ a_c,  b = Σ b_c,  bb = Σ bb_c
#   4. Mix phase-function moments scattering-weighted: β = Σ (b_c / b) β_c
#   5. Compute τ = (a + b) Δz,  ϖ = b / (a + b),  B = bb / b
#
# The whole operation is linear in the constituent count and wavelength count.

    layer_optics(layer, λ_grid; ℓ_max=64, FT=Float64) -> OceanLayerOptics

Compute the complete optical bundle for one ocean layer at each wavelength
in `λ_grid`.

# Arguments
- `layer::OceanLayer` — the layer (constituents + thickness)
- `λ_grid` — vector of wavelengths [nm]; plain `AbstractVector{<:Real}` or
  `Unitful` with spectral units
- `ℓ_max` — maximum Legendre order for the phase-function expansion
  (default 64, which is adequate for Gauss-Lobatto RT with N ≤ 32)
- `FT` — floating-point precision

# Returns
An [`OceanLayerOptics`](@ref) containing τ, ϖ, β_ℓ(λ) and the diagnostic
backscatter fraction B, all on the `λ_grid`.

# Notes
This function handles only the *elastic* IOPs. Inelastic source terms
(fluorescence, Raman) are computed separately by
[`inelastic_sources`](@ref) from a scalar irradiance field `E°(τ, λ)`
obtained by a first-pass elastic solve (see Fell 1997 §2.2.9).

# Example

```julia
water = PureWater{Float64}()
chl   = Phytoplankton{Float64, Bricaud1995}(Chl = 0.5)
layer = OceanLayer(0.0, 5.0, [water, chl])
λ     = 400.0:5.0:700.0

opt = layer_optics(layer, collect(λ); ℓ_max = 64)
# opt.τ, opt.ϖ, opt.β all have one column/entry per λ.
```

# This is a thin shim — it does *no work*, just repackages the data into

    to_core_scattering_properties(o::OceanLayerOptics) -> NamedTuple

Adapter producing a drop-in replacement for
`vSmartMOM.CoreRT.CoreScatteringOpticalProperties`.

Returns a `NamedTuple` with fields `(τ, ϖ, Z⁺⁺, Z⁻⁺)` where:

- `τ, ϖ` — per-λ vectors, already thickness-integrated
- `Z⁺⁺, Z⁻⁺` — forward and backward phase-matrix blocks in vSmartMOM's
  expected shape `[nμN × nμN × nλ]`; actually building these requires
  vSmartMOM's quadrature (`qp_μN`) and Greek-coefficient-to-Z-matrix
  machinery (`compute_Z_matrices`), which live outside this package.

This stub returns β-only (scalar RT) with an empty Z placeholder; the
actual Z-matrix computation happens in vSmartMOM when the package
extension `OceanOpticsVSmartMOMExt` is loaded.

# Design rationale
OceanOptics.jl deliberately does *not* depend on vSmartMOM. Users who
want the full Z-matrices call `compute_Z_matrices` themselves from
vSmartMOM with our `β_ℓ` as input; users who want to use a different
RT code (HydroLight-style ODE solver, Monte Carlo, SOS) compute their
own angular kernels from β_ℓ.
